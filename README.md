#   Search
## Introduction;

This program imitates the Google search engines; Images search, Advanced search and Search. Each one is on a diferent page. I made extensive use of "view page source" on the Google web site to get the search parameters I used.

I have done all of my styling in css without the use of bootstrap or other third party libraries, to try to improve my understanding of the basics of web programing.

## index.html
In this file I used  name ="q" in the search input and action went to www.google/search. To add some color to the page I included the google logo.

## image_search.html.
in this file I used name ="q"  and action went to www.google/images. I added google images icons to that page.

## advanced_ search>

## styles.css
I used @media to alter the screen size for mobile devices as well as flexbox.
